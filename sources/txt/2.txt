Results Nurse academics understand their academic identity as research-related, relational and dynamic. Although their academic identity can be in conflict with their clinical one, the former is (re)constructed as an extension of the latter. To navigate each university's multiple expectations of academics, nurse academics in this study strive to maintain their engagement with teaching, research and clinical practice, although in some cases, clinical practice is reconceptualised.
Conclusion this study reveals an interrelated, dual process of identity (re)construction. Bby (re)constructing the academic identity, nurse academic participants reshape and redefine their clinical identity. The trajectory of their identity development challenges institutions to consider the needs of nurse academics (and others in similar disciplines) by recognising and supporting the maintenance of a form of clinical currency in order to strengthen the discipline within the academy.
