This time, our visit is composed of scholars of different majors. The most interesting thing is that we have a "cultural man" - as a legal scholar called him. A cultural man is not only a speaker, but also a researcher of world literature and Linguistics (I used to envy him that your major is our hobby, but you are a major). The cultural people temporarily organized a "walking group" to take us for a walk every day after breakfast (20 minutes to an hour). It not only dissipates food, but also browses the beautiful scenery of the city. We travel and socialize every day, and we will be very tired in the evening, but the cultural people have to do their homework every night, that is, to check the cultural and historical scenic spots near the hotels in the area, so that we can have a glimpse of them the next day. Many of the photos below were taken during morning walks, visits and after meetings.

The second stop of our visit is the University of Vienna. Vienna is the capital of Austria. It is located in the Vienna basin at the northern foot of the Alps in the northeast of Austria. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides. The famous Danube River passes through the city. Vienna is the most beautiful city on our trip to European universities. The beauty lies in her architecture, her culture and her music. Therefore, Vienna has the reputation of "the city of music", "the city of architecture", "the city of culture" and "the city of decoration". In addition, the new year's concert in Vienna has long been an international musical event. The University of Vienna is the largest university in Austria and one of the largest universities in Europe. Founded in 1365, it is the alma mater of 27 Nobel Prize winners. There are also several sinologists here who can speak fluent Chinese and have studied in China in different years. The important thing is that they love China.
